1) Movie Review Game (**Note**: I do not believe Letterboxd API has a way to access user reviews)
   - Idea 1 is a game in which a Letterboxd review greets the user. The point of the game is to guess the movie based on the Letterboxd review. With each incorrect guess, the game gives the user select information about the movie such as the genre, release year, director, and leading cast member(s) (these are just examples). If the user exhausts all of these hints, the user loses. But if at any time the user guesses correctly, they win. 
     *Note: It may be best to find some way of censoring “give-away” movie information such as the movie title in the Letterboxd review*

2) Concert Recommendation (*Currently working on*)
   - Idea 2 is a service-type website in which the user’s Spotify listening history (could be through playlists, artists, top artists of the month, etc.) to recommend a concert/event for an artist that is similar to the user’s music listened to. This would be done through utilizing Ticketmaster and through the user’s input for the desired region.
